This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I built this project prompting and instructing AI to generate the code for me. I used Claude Sonnet 3.7, 
Cursor, DeepSeek and GitHub Copilot.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Main Functionality

This project is a prompt evaluation tool that allows users to evaluate prompts using an AI model or manually. Users can input prompts and receive evaluations based on predefined criteria.

### Features

- **AI Evaluation**: Evaluate prompts using an integrated AI model.
- **Manual Evaluation**: Manually evaluate prompts based on user-defined criteria.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get instant feedback as you type your prompts.
- **History Tracking**: Keep track of previously evaluated prompts.
- **Customizable Criteria**: Define and customize the criteria for manual evaluations.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
